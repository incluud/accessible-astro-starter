    <h2>Trust by design</h2>
    <p>
      Stokoe is designed so trust does not depend on interpretation, cloud services, or opaque models. The five-lane architecture makes it clear which operations are deterministic and which are interpretive.
    </p>

    <Callout type="info">
      Real-time lanes (A & B) operate independently of enrichment lanes (C, D, E). Your captions and sound awareness never depend on cloud services or AI interpretation.
    </Callout>

    <h3>Privacy principles</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Local-first processing:</strong> Real-time lanes can operate entirely on-device</li>
      <li><strong>Clear data boundaries:</strong> You know exactly what data is processed where</li>
      <li><strong>No hidden interpretation:</strong> Enrichment is always optional and visible</li>
      <li><strong>User control:</strong> You decide which lanes to enable and where they run</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Open architecture</h3>
    <p>
      The five-lane separation makes Stokoe inspectable and auditable. You can verify that real-time captions are deterministic, that enrichment doesn't block core functionality, and that your privacy preferences are respected.
