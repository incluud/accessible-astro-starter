No one really knows who The Eight were originally. Now, they are the remnants of the souls of the original Eight. They are
the paradigms of the original Eight. These paradigms have no real worldly analog, but are found throughout literature 
throughout history - Warrior, Mage, Knight, Wolf, Druid, Ranger, Scholar, Apprentice, and Friend. All of these possess
a bit of knowledge of Home, but none seem to hold enough to be able to tell the entire Story, as their souls are too
fragmented now. Not even I know the whole Story, but I am attempted to tell what I know here.


## Warrior

The Warrior soul is a soul of someone who is headstrong. Itching to fight and would rather enjoy the battle than
talk. Despite this, they do ot just jump into battle and would rather get to know their challengers first. 

## Mage

These are souls who connect knowledge with the world around them. 


## Knight 

Knights are souls who believe in fighting for the right things. They never lack direction and always seem to know
what they want and where they are going.

## Wolf

## Druid

## Ranger 

## Scholar

Scholars are those who watch. Watch and learn all about the world around them. They prefer to be alone but are
perfectly happy around others, in the middle of all the action.

## Apprentice

The Apprentice prefers to experience life through others. They will attach themselves to their friends and love
listening to the lives of others.


## Friend
