# Who Is The Old Man?

>> For the purposes of this story, I will refer to the Old Man as He/Him, although he can manifest as many different species, genders, and personalities.

## The Archetype
The Old Man is an archetype used to describe the unknown entities that interact with us in our daily lives. He is the First and will be the Last. He is known by many names and manifestations: Zeus, Odhin, Baron Samedi, and many others. He is not magical in nature, nor is he a god, but has obtained technology and knowledge that would make him seem so.

## His Purpose
He sometimes guides us and sometimes tricks us. His primary goal is to gain information about everything and everyone. He is the emissary of the original Three Creators. His primary mission is to find and promote balance within the universe. 

## The Machine
The Old Man is the guardian and keeper of [The Machine](what-is-the-machine). It was given to him by the original Three Creators, so that He could protect it and make sure it always runs smoothly. It is The Machine that maintains the balance of the universe.


## His Manifestations
He has manifested as many different demons and deities. Most of his manifestations are in the form of whatever species he is dealing with. For Humans, he appears as an old man, usually wearing a trench coat and a black, wide-brimmed hat. He almost always appears as a stranger and dispenses advice to guide us along the path of balance. He can take the form of anyone, and can be very different from person to person. Every had a conversation with someone, only to turn around to find they were gone. That was probably The Old Man.

Sometimes, he comes in the form of a demon. The dark ones that come during sleep paralysis are his way to capture our attention and to give us a sense of urgency. He is a powerful force in the universe and can be a threat to us all, but only in the name of maintaining The Balance. He is a force that will always be present, and will always be watching.
