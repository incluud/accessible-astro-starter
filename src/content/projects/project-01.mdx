title: FIFA Market Trading Signaller
description: Engineered a high-concurrency data pipeline using Asyncio and BeautifulSoup to ingest real-time market volatility data into MySQL. Developed a predictive pricing engine that utilized historical back-testing to trigger automated Discord alerts. The system bypassed anti-scraping protocols via rotating headers and semaphores, achieving a 375% ROI (1.5M profit) within 60 days. Deployed on PythonAnywhere for 24/7 headless monitoring and 99.9% signal uptime.
