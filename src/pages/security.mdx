# Security & Privacy

Stokoe is built with security and privacy as foundational principles. This document explains how we protect your data and what you can expect from us.

<Heading level="h2">Threat model</Heading>

We design against realistic threats:

- **Unauthorized access**: Only authenticated users can access their own data
- **Data interception**: All data is encrypted in transit via TLS
- **Credential theft**: Secrets are never stored in code or client-side storage
- **Session hijacking**: Sessions are short-lived and validated server-side

We assume our infrastructure could be targeted, so we minimize what we store and encrypt what we must keep.

<Heading level="h2">Data minimization</Heading>

We collect only what is necessary to provide the service:

- No tracking pixels or analytics that profile behavior
- No marketing cookies or third-party ad scripts
- No social login that shares data with external platforms
- We avoid storing sensitive data when ephemeral processing suffices

<Heading level="h2">Retention & deletion</Heading>

- User data is retained only as long as the account is active
- Upon account deletion, associated data is purged within 30 days
- Backups are encrypted and rotated; deleted data expires from backups naturally
- You can request a full data export or deletion at any time

<Heading level="h2">Encryption</Heading>

**In transit**: All connections use TLS 1.2+ with modern cipher suites. HTTP is redirected to HTTPS.

**At rest**: Stored data is encrypted using industry-standard algorithms. We do not roll our own cryptography.

We are transparent about our limitations: we use hosted infrastructure, and absolute guarantees are not possible. We apply defense in depth.

<Heading level="h2">Key management</Heading>

- Secrets (API keys, tokens) are stored in environment variables, not in source code
- Production secrets are managed via Cloudflare environment configuration
- No secrets are committed to the repository or exposed in client bundles
- Access to production secrets is limited to authorized personnel

<Heading level="h2">Auditability</Heading>

- All significant actions generate append-only event logs
- Events include stable identifiers and ISO 8601 timestamps
- Logs are retained for compliance and debugging purposes
- We do not use logs for behavioral profiling

<Heading level="h2">Responsible disclosure</Heading>

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

- Email: **security@stokoe.app**
- We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- We will not take legal action against good-faith security researchers
- We will credit researchers (with permission) once issues are resolved

<Heading level="h2">What we do NOT do</Heading>

- **No ad trackers**: We do not use Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, or similar services
- **No data sales**: We never sell or share your data with third parties for marketing
- **No silent profiling**: We do not build behavioral profiles for advertising or resale
- **No dark patterns**: We do not use manipulative UI to extract consent or data
- **No unnecessary permissions**: We request only the access we need to function
