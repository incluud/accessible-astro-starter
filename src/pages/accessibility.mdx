# Accessibility

Stokoe is committed to providing an accessible experience for all users. Accessibility is not an afterthought—it is a core design principle.

<Heading level="h2">Our commitment</Heading>

We aim to conform to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 at Level AA. This means:

- Content is perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust
- Users with disabilities can navigate, understand, and interact with our interface
- We test with real assistive technologies, not just automated tools

<Heading level="h2">Tested behaviors</Heading>

The following accessibility features are implemented and tested:

**Keyboard navigation**
- All interactive elements are reachable via keyboard
- Focus order follows a logical reading sequence
- No keyboard traps—you can always navigate away

**Focus visibility**
- Focus indicators are visible and meet contrast requirements
- Custom focus styles ensure clarity across components
- Focus is managed appropriately during dynamic interactions

**Reduced motion**
- Animations respect the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
- Essential motion is minimized; decorative motion is eliminated
- No content relies solely on animation to convey meaning

**Semantic landmarks**
- Pages use proper HTML5 landmarks (`main`, `nav`, `header`, `footer`)
- Skip links allow bypassing repetitive navigation
- Heading hierarchy is logical and sequential

<Heading level="h2">Assistive technology</Heading>

We test with:

- **Screen readers**: VoiceOver (macOS/iOS), NVDA (Windows)
- **Zoom**: Browser zoom up to 400% maintains usability
- **High contrast**: Interfaces remain usable in high-contrast modes
- **Voice control**: Basic navigation works with voice input software

<Heading level="h2">Known limitations</Heading>

We are transparent about current limitations:

- Some third-party embeds may not meet our accessibility standards
- Complex data visualizations may require alternative text descriptions
- Legacy content is being progressively improved

We track known issues and prioritize fixes based on user impact.

<Heading level="h2">Feedback</Heading>

If you encounter a barrier or have suggestions for improvement, please let us know:

- **Email**: accessibility@stokoe.app
- Include the URL where you experienced the issue
- Describe what happened and what you expected

We respond to accessibility feedback within 5 business days.

<Heading level="h2">Accessibility and trust</Heading>

Accessibility is part of our broader commitment to trustworthy software. An accessible product is one that respects its users. For more about how we protect your data, see our <Link href="/security">Security & Privacy</Link> page.
